### The Things i learn by doing this Project.
- This was a great experience for me because i have never made this much long Web Page till now, and i really enjoyed it.

- In this Project I use both Positions and Flex Box for aligning elements according to my requirement.

1.<b>Positions :</b> You can use the CSS position property to position elements, divs, and containers in CSS according to your needs. The great thing about the position property is that you can use it to arrange elements anywhere you want.

2.<b>Flexbox :</b>  CSS Flexbox property to arrange items without using float. This makes arranging items in the document much easier.

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
